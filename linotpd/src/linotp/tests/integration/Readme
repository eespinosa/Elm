Dependencies
============================================

You need to install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt

I recommend creating a virtualenv and installing the dependencies there:

$ mkdir /opt/selenium-venv
$ virtualenv /opt/selenium-venv
$ source /opt/selenium-venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need an X-Server on your machine (or a virtual framebuffer such as
xvfb) and Firefox. When using a virtual framebuffer set the $DISPLAY env
variable before executing the tests.


Server Configuration file
============================================

To run the LinOTP Selenium Tests you need a server.cfg file.

A default file for CentOS Server beggar is supplied: server_cfg.ini


Chrome driver
============================================

The Chrome Selenium driver (for Google Chrome or Chromium) is faster and is
therefore used by default.

You can specify a different driver by editing the config file (server_cfg.ini)
or using the option --tc=selenium.driver:firefox


To install the Chrome driver on Ubuntu (14.04 and higher) follow these steps:
$ sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

On Debian jessie the the Chrome driver package is named 'chromedriver'.
$ sudo apt-get install chromedriver
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

If the Chrome driver is not available in your package management system use
these steps:
$ cd /usr/local/bin/
Check for the latest Chromium driver:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
At time of writing 2.16 is the newest.
$ wget http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.16/chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ rm chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ mv chromedriver chromedriver-2.16
$ chmod 755 chromedriver-2.16
$ ln -s chromedriver-2.16 chromedriver
$ cd /usr/bin/
$ ln -s chromium-browser google-chrome


Execution
============================================

$ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini test_create_useridresolvers.py

It is possible to overwrite some specific cfg settings as follows:

$ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini --tc=linotp.host:10.76.124.35 \
    test_create_useridresolvers.py
